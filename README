This is the source code for the online book on Developer Evangelism 
available at http://developer-evangelism.com. The book is licenced
with Creative Commons and I very much invite translations into other
languages.

To change the content of the book you basically edit the content.php file - 
the switches tell you when which chapter starts or ends.
